### Gorutines

By default go executes our code sequentially meaning that it executes one line at a time and if something takes longer to execute (like a network call) it will block the rest of the code from executing.

Which is not a great user experience as our app will be stuck and feel stuck when in fact it is waiting for a task to finish.

let's simulate this by making the main thread sleep:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Main function started")
    heavyWorkload()
    fmt.Println("Done with main")
}

func heavyWorkload() {
    fmt.Println("heavy workload started")
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) // waiting for 10 seconds
    fmt.Println("heavyWorkload finished")
}
```

Output:

```
Main function started
heavy workload started
heavyWorkload finished
Done with main
```

As you can see the main thread is blocked and waiting for the heavy workload to finish. 

We can use the goroutines to run this blocking code on a secondary background thread just by using `go` keyword. This is crazy stuff.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

var wg = sync.WaitGroup{} // creates a wait group

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Main function started")

	wg.Add(1) // no of thread to wait for
	go heavyWorkload()

	fmt.Println("Done with main")

	wg.Wait() // waiting for all threads to finish
}

func heavyWorkload() {
    fmt.Println("heavy workload started")
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) // waiting for 10 seconds
    fmt.Println("heavyWorkload finished")

	wg.Done() // finished with this thread
}
```

Output:

```
Main function started
Done with main
heavy workload started
heavyWorkload finished
```

Now we can see that the main thread is not blocked anymore and the heavy workload is executed in a separate thread.

> **Warning**

> Note that we have created a wait group and added one thread to it. This is because if we don't do this and the main thread finishes its tasks before the background threads finish, the program will exit and background threads will be terminated.

`Wait groups` esentially makes the main thread to wait for all the threads to finish. First we created a wait group using `sync.WaitGroup{}` and assigned it to wg variable.

Wait group has three methods:

- Add: adds a thread to the wait group
- Wait: waits for the thread count to hit 0
- Done: decrements the thread count

first we add a thread using the `Add` method and passes 1 as we are adding one thread. Then we use `Done` method in the end of `heavyWorkload` function, and finally we use the `Wait` in the main thread.
