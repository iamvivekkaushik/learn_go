### Formatting Output with `Printf`

Whenever we're printing our text mixed with variables we use another function from the `fmt` package called `Printf`.

This function is specifically used for formatting text, which makes using variables in our code much more readable and easy to understand.

In the previous chapter we used the print statement to show the avaiable and remaining tickets for the conference. Let's see how we can use `printf` to make that more readable.

```go
fmt.Printf("Welcome to %v booking application\n", conferenceName)
fmt.Printf("We have total of %v tickets and %v are still remaining.\n", conferenceTickets, remainingTickets)
```

One thing you may notice is that we used the `%v` format specifier to print the variables. This is a special format specifier that is used to print the value of the variable. These characters tells go where to swap the variable value in the string.

Also a "\n" is used, it is a special characters that we can use to print a new line, these are called escape sequences. We will learn more about escape sequences in the later chapter.


You can find out more format specifiers at [`fmt` package](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/).

> **Note**
> You can use the %T to print the data type of a variable.

Here is another example of using `Printf` to print the variables:

```go
var number = 8
fmt.Printf("%v is reperesented in binary as %b and in decimal as %d\n", number, number, number)

var decimalNumber = 29.2353456
fmt.Printf("\nOriginal Number %f\n", decimalNumber)
fmt.Printf("After rounding to 2 decimal places %.2f\n", decimalNumber)
```

Output for the previous code:

```
8 is reperesented in binary as 1000 and in decimal as 8

Original Number 29.235346
After rounding to 2 decimal places 29.24%
```
