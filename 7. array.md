### Array

Currently we're saving user data in variables like "name", "emai", etc. but what if we need to store data of multiple users? creating new variables for every new user is not feasible. So we make use of different data structures.

For this we have `Arrays` and `Slices`. These are we common in go applications.

When creating an array we need to know its size beforehand (how many elements it can hold)

```go
var bookings = [50]string{}
```

First we're defining an variable `bookings` which hold mermory address for the array, after the `=` sign we're defining the size of the array and then the type of the data this array will hold and finally the `{}` is the initial value of the array, which is currently empty. 

You can also add initial values by providing them in the `{}` separated by a comma.

For accessing or manipulating the elements of an array we use the index of the element. like so `bookings[0]`. Arrays start counting from 0 in go so 0 is the first element here.

```go
var bookings = [50]string{}

bookings[0] = "Vivek"
bookings[1] = "Sachin"

fmt.Println(bookings[0]) // this will print "Vivek"
fmt.Println(bookings[1]) // this will print "Sachin"

bookings[1] = "Sachin Tendulkar" // Reassign the value at index 1
fmt.Println(bookings[1]) // Will print "Sachin Tendulkar"

fmt.Printf("length of the array: %v\n", len(bookings)) // Will print "length of the array: 50"
```


### Slices

What if you don't know size of the array beforehand? This is where `Slices` comes in.

For slice we don't have to define a size, they are dynamic and can grow and shrink as needed.


```go
var bookings = []string{}

bookings = append(bookings, "Vivek")
```

In slices we don't have to know the index of where we need to add the element, we just need to add it to the end of the slice using the `append` function. It is a built in function just like `len` used previous to get the length of the array.

Append takes two arguments, the slice and the element to add.

Here's our booking app:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
    var conferenceTickets int = 0
    var remainingTickets int = 50
	var bookings = []string{}

	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
    fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
    fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")
	
	var firstName string
	var lastName string
	var email string
	userTickets := 0 // another way of creating a variable

	fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&firstName)
	
	fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&lastName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
	fmt.Scan(&email)

	fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
	fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

	remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets
	bookings = append(bookings, firstName + " " + lastName)

	fmt.Printf("User %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, userTickets)
	fmt.Printf("%v tickets remaining.\n", remainingTickets)
	fmt.Printf("These are all the bookings so far: %v\n", bookings)
}
```
