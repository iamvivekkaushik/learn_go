### Writing a "Hello world" application

First you need to create a file called main.go in the root of your folder.

In that file, first you need to define your package which `main`, then we will import another module called `fmt` this module is used to write output to the standard output.

Every program in go will have a entry point from a `main` function next we need to create our program's entry point.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

Save the file and use the `go run main.go` command to run the program.
