# init

First you need to initialize your directory to execute code. In go everything is contained in a package, the code you wanna write will also need to be in its own package.

A module is defined by a tree of source files, with a go.mod file in its root. When the go command runs, it looks in the current directory and then successive parent directories to find the go.mod marking the root of the main (current) module.

To create a go.mod file, use:

```
go mod init <package-name>
```

To add  missing module requirements or remove unneeded requirements, use:

```
go mod tidy
```

To add, upgrade, downgrade, or remove a specific module requirement, use:

```
go get
```

To finally run your program use:

```
go run main.app
```
