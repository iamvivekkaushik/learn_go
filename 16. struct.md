### Struct

A lot of times we do want to store data of different types. This is where structs comes in.

Struct stands for "Structure", struct can hodl data of different types. 

```go
type UserData struct {
    firstName string
    lastName string
    email string
    noOfTickets uint
    isActive bool
}
```

We start of with the `type` keyword, which tells the compiler that we are creating a new type. We then define the name of the type, which is `UserData`, followed by the struct keyword. We then define the fields of the type, which are `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `noOfTickets`, and `isActive`.


> **Note**

> For java programmers, the `struct` is comparable to a data class.


You can define methods for structs. There are two types of methods one is called `Value Receiver` and the other is called `Pointer Receiver`.

`Value Receiver Methods` don't manipulate the data of the struct instance, they just use the data passed to them. Even if they did manipulate the data, they would not change the data of the struct instance. As it is passed by value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"


type UserData struct {
    firstName string
    lastName string
    email string
	age int
}

func (u UserData) getFullName() string {
	return u.firstName + " " + u.lastName
}

func main() {
	user := UserData{
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Doe",
		email: "john@example.com",
		age: 30}

	fmt.Println(user.getFullName())
}
```

`Reference Receiver Methods` are used to manipulate the data of the struct instance. They are passed by reference.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

type UserData struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	email     string
	age       int
}

func (u UserData) getAge() string {
	return u.firstName + "'s current age is " + strconv.Itoa(u.age)
}

func (u *UserData) setAge(age int) {
	u.age = age
}

func main() {
	user := UserData{
		firstName: "John",
		lastName:  "Doe",
		email:     "john@example.com",
		age:       30}

	fmt.Println(user.getAge())
	user.setAge(35)
	fmt.Println(user.getAge())
}
```

This is how our booking app looks like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type UserData struct {
	firstName   string
	lastName    string
	email       string
	noOfTickets uint
}

func main() {
	var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
	var conferenceTickets uint = 0
	var remainingTickets uint = 50
	var bookings = make([]UserData, 0)

	greetUser(conferenceName, conferenceTickets, remainingTickets)

	for {
		var firstName, lastName, email, userTickets = getInput()

		if userTickets > remainingTickets {
			fmt.Printf("Sorry, only %v tickets are remaining. Please try again.\n", remainingTickets)
			continue // skips this iteration of the loop the loop
		}

		remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets

		var userData = UserData{
			firstName:   firstName,
			lastName:    lastName,
			email:       email,
			noOfTickets: userTickets,
		}

		bookings = append(bookings, userData)

		showSummary(firstName, email, userTickets, remainingTickets, bookings)

		if remainingTickets == 0 {
			fmt.Println("We are sold out!")
			break // terminates the loop
		}
	}
}

func greetUser(conferenceName string, conferenceTickets uint, remainingTickets uint) {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
	fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
	fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")
}

func getInput() (string, string, string, uint) {
	var firstName string
	var lastName string
	var email string
	var userTickets uint = 0

	fmt.Println("-----------------------")
	fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&firstName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&lastName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
	fmt.Scan(&email)

	fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
	fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

	return firstName, lastName, email, userTickets
}

func showSummary(firstName string, email string, userTickets uint, remainingTickets uint, bookings []UserData) {
	fmt.Println("=====================================")
	fmt.Printf("User %s with email %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, email, userTickets)
	fmt.Printf("%v tickets remaining.\n", remainingTickets)

	fmt.Println("These are all the bookings so far:")
	for _, booking := range bookings {
		fmt.Printf("%v\n", booking.firstName)
	}
	fmt.Println("=====================================")
}
```
