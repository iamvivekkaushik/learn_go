### Struct

A lot of times we do want to store data of different types. This is where structs comes in.

Struct stands for "Structure", struct can hodl data of different types. 

```go
type UserData struct {
    firstName string
    lastName string
    email string
    noOfTickets uint
    isActive bool
}
```

We start of with the `type` keyword, which tells the compiler that we are creating a new type. We then define the name of the type, which is `UserData`, followed by the struct keyword. We then define the fields of the type, which are `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `noOfTickets`, and `isActive`.


> **Note**

> For java programmers, the `struct` is comparable to a data class. struct however does not support inheritance.

This is how our booking app looks like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type UserData struct {
	firstName   string
	lastName    string
	email       string
	noOfTickets uint
}

func main() {
	var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
	var conferenceTickets uint = 0
	var remainingTickets uint = 50
	var bookings = make([]UserData, 0)

	greetUser(conferenceName, conferenceTickets, remainingTickets)

	for {
		var firstName, lastName, email, userTickets = getInput()

		if userTickets > remainingTickets {
			fmt.Printf("Sorry, only %v tickets are remaining. Please try again.\n", remainingTickets)
			continue // skips this iteration of the loop the loop
		}

		remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets

		var userData = UserData{
			firstName:   firstName,
			lastName:    lastName,
			email:       email,
			noOfTickets: userTickets,
		}

		bookings = append(bookings, userData)

		showSummary(firstName, email, userTickets, remainingTickets, bookings)

		if remainingTickets == 0 {
			fmt.Println("We are sold out!")
			break // terminates the loop
		}
	}
}

func greetUser(conferenceName string, conferenceTickets uint, remainingTickets uint) {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
	fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
	fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")
}

func getInput() (string, string, string, uint) {
	var firstName string
	var lastName string
	var email string
	var userTickets uint = 0

	fmt.Println("-----------------------")
	fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&firstName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&lastName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
	fmt.Scan(&email)

	fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
	fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

	return firstName, lastName, email, userTickets
}

func showSummary(firstName string, email string, userTickets uint, remainingTickets uint, bookings []UserData) {
	fmt.Println("=====================================")
	fmt.Printf("User %s with email %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, email, userTickets)
	fmt.Printf("%v tickets remaining.\n", remainingTickets)

	fmt.Println("These are all the bookings so far:")
	for _, booking := range bookings {
		fmt.Printf("%v\n", booking.firstName)
	}
	fmt.Println("=====================================")
}
```
