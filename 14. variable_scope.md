### Variable Scope

Variables have 3 levels of scope

- local
- package
- global

#### local

local Variables are declared in a function or blocks (if-else, for loop) and can be used only in that function or block.

### package

Package variables are declared in the package and can be used within the same package.

### global

Global variables are declared outside of any function and can be used in any function.

We can create global variable using the capitalize variable name.

```go
var GlobalVariable string = "Global Variable"
```
