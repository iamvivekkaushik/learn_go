### Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code. In Go you only have for loops:

```go
for condition {
    // do something
}
```

This was an indefinite loop as there was no condition provided for it stop.

We have another version of for loop that can iterate over an array or slice:

```go
var bookings = []string{"Vivek", "Kartik", "Harsh"}

for index, booking := range bookings {
    fmt.Println(booking)
}
```

If you try to run above code you will get an error saying index is defined but not used. But we cannot remove the index as the range will return two values. We can use `_` in place of index which will ignore the warning this is called `Blank Identifier`.

Here's our program using the for loop:

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
	var conferenceTickets int = 0
	var remainingTickets int = 50
	var bookings = []string{}

	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
	fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
	fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")

	for {
		var firstName string
		var lastName string
		var email string
		userTickets := 0 // another way of creating a variable

		fmt.Println("-----------------------")
		fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
		fmt.Scan(&firstName)

		fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
		fmt.Scan(&lastName)

		fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
		fmt.Scan(&email)

		fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
		fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

		remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets
		bookings = append(bookings, firstName+" "+lastName)

		fmt.Println("=====================================")
		fmt.Printf("User %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, userTickets)
		fmt.Printf("%v tickets remaining.\n", remainingTickets)
		fmt.Printf("These are all the bookings so far: %v\n", bookings)
		fmt.Println("=====================================")
	}
}
```
