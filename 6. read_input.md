# Getting user input

A program needs to get some input from its user to perform a task. In our case we want to get user's details and assign them a conference ticket.

`fmt` has a method called `Scan` that can be used to get user input. Scan takes a parameter in this parameter we need to pass the memory location (variable's address/pointer) as an argument. Here's how it works:

When we create a variable we create a variable name and assign it a value. On the runtime this variable is provided with a memory address (pointer) that points to the memory location where the value is stored.

`&` before a variable name will give us the memory address assigned to that variable.

```go
var hello string = "Hello"

fmt.Println(&hello) // Output 0xc000096220
```

> **Note**
> Your output might be different

```go
var userName string
fmt.Scan(&userName)
```


Here's our program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
    var conferenceTickets int = 0
    var remainingTickets int = 50

	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
    fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
    fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")
	
	var firstName string
	var lastName string
	var email string
	userTickets := 0 // another way of creating a variable

	fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&firstName)
	
	fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
	fmt.Scan(&lastName)

	fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
	fmt.Scan(&email)

	fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
	fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

	fmt.Printf("User %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, userTickets)
}
```
