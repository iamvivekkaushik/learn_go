### Packages

Until now we've been working with a single file, but for a more complex application you'd want to seprate different logics in different files to essentially modularize the application.

Go prams are organized into packages. A package is a collection of Go files.

When we have different packages we should create a separate folder for them and use that to store all the files in that package.

To use a function from different package you will have to import the package first.

let's create a new folder called `helper` and put a file called helper.go in that with the following content:

```go
package helper

import "fmt"

func thisWillNotBeUsed() {
    fmt.Println("This function can not be used outside the helper pacakge.")
}


func SomeHelperFunction() {
    fmt.Println("I'm a helper function...")
}
```
> **Note**

> Whenever we know a function will be used outside of the package we need to export it. This can be done by capitalizing the file character of the function.

to use the function from helper package we will import it inside the main.go file:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "booking-app/helper"
)

func main() {
    helper.SomeHelperFunction()
}
```

> **Note**

> We need to use the module name when importing a package from our own module followed by a "/" and the package name.
