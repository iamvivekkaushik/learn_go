Let's start with our Booking app. First we will greet our user.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to our conference booking application")
    fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")
}
```


### Variables

We can define a variable use the `var` keyword.

```go
var conferenceName = "Go Conference"
```

When we define a variable but don't use it, it's an error, same thing happens if we import a module and don't use it.

You can also define the data type of a variable by providing the type after the variable name, like so:

```go
var conferenceName string = "Go Conference"
var emptyText string // this will be empty text
var number int // This will be initialized with 0 by default
var isAllowed bool // This will be initialed with false by default
```

### Constants

Constants are like variables, except that their values cannot be changed.

```go
const conferenceTickets = 50
```

### Using variables

Finally we will use a variable to store the conference name and print the welcome message directly in our booking app.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
    const conferenceTickets = 50
    var remainingTickets int = conferenceTickets

	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
    fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
    fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend") 
}
```
