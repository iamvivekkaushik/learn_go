### Switch Statement

Switch Statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It may sound similar to if-else statement, but it is different. Here's how you can use them:

```go
var number int = 5

switch number {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("One")
case 2, 3:
    fmt.Println("Two or Three")
case 4, 5, 6:
    fmt.Println("Four, Five, or Six")
default:
    fmt.Println("Default")
}
```

The above code will print the following output:

```
Four, Five, or Six
```
