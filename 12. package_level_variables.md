### Package level variables

These variables are available in the package scope. They can be accessed inside any of the functions and in all files, which are in the same package.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var packageLevelVar string = "package level variable"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(packageLevelVar)
}
```

> **Note**
> Generally you would want to define local variables. Defining package level variables is only for special cases and considered bad practice.
