### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are something that can be used to make your program do different things based on different conditions.

```go
if condition {
    // do something if condition is true
} else if condition {

} else {
    // do something else if condition is false
}
```

Currently our bookings program keeps on asking for new booking even if all the tickets are sold out. We can fix this using the conditional statements.

```go
if remainingTickets <= 0 {
    fmt.Println("Sorry, we are sold out!")
    break // terminates the loop
}
```

We still have another issue in our program, and that is if we try to book more tickets that what is currently available, our program will happily let you do that. Which is not ideal. Let's fix that as well:

```go
if userTickets > remainingTickets {
    fmt.Printf("Sorry, only %v tickets are remaining\n", remainingTickets)
    continue // skips this iteration of the loop the loop
}
```

Here's the final program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var conferenceName string = "Go conference"
	var conferenceTickets int = 0
	var remainingTickets int = 50
	var bookings = []string{}

	fmt.Println("Welcome to", conferenceName, "booking application")
	fmt.Println("We have total of", conferenceTickets, "tickets and", remainingTickets, "are still remaining.")
	fmt.Println("Get your tickets here to attend")

	for {
		var firstName string
		var lastName string
		var email string
		userTickets := 0 // another way of creating a variable

		fmt.Println("-----------------------")
		fmt.Println("Enter your first name: ")
		fmt.Scan(&firstName)

		fmt.Println("Enter your last name: ")
		fmt.Scan(&lastName)

		fmt.Println("Enter your email: ")
		fmt.Scan(&email)

		fmt.Println("Enter the number of tickets you want: ")
		fmt.Scan(&userTickets)


		if userTickets > remainingTickets {
			fmt.Printf("Sorry, only %v tickets are remaining. Please try again.\n", remainingTickets)
			continue // skips this iteration of the loop the loop
		}


		remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets
		bookings = append(bookings, firstName+" "+lastName)

        fmt.Println("=====================================")
		fmt.Printf("User %s booked %v tickets.\n", firstName, userTickets)
		fmt.Printf("%v tickets remaining.\n", remainingTickets)
		fmt.Printf("These are all the bookings so far: %v\n", bookings)
		fmt.Println("=====================================")

        if remainingTickets == 0 {
			fmt.Println("We are sold out!")
			break // terminates the loop
		}
	}
}
```
